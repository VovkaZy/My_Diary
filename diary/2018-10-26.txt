Hi, this is my first story to you, my Diary!

My name is Vovka and I live in Kiev since 2011.
From 2006 to 2011, before moving to Kiev, I lived in Sevastopol, Crimea.
Where I’ve got technical education as a systems engineer at Sevastopol National Technical University.

Since school time, I liked sales. And for a long time I was in sales 2005 - 2018.
It was offline and online markets, b2b and b2c, even cryptocurrencies and I was good in this field.
But let's back to my Kiev period of life.

After moving to Kiev, I was engaged in entrepreneurial activity for a long time.
I started business in Kiev, Ukraine. 
I worked with China and sold various goods online both wholesale and retail.
I’ve ran a store on Amazon, learned how to play the ukulele, improved my languages skills, traveled (until couchsurfing became mainstream), explored the world and other cultures, met interesting people during my journeys.

But afterwhile I realized that it's interesting for me to develop myself in the direction of education that I received at the University.
Therefore, I spent last few months in studying Ruby programming language (with frameworks) and everything related to QA theory, testing (cucumber, selenium),
Internet Security (pentesting with Kali Linux tools: wpscan , metasploit, sqlmap), programming patterns and Web-tech (JS, HTML/HAML, CSS/SCSS).

All this seems very interesting to me. 
At this moment I’m completing my self-education program, preparing my CV, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles and will look for a job on position of QA Automation/Ruby.

This is the end of my first story. Hope you enjoyed it.
Thank you.
